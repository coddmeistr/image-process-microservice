# Image Process Microservice
In this project I want to implement a small microservice for working with images

### What I've done
Built a service architecture that allows you to process endpoints

Wrote code to load images and get pixel matrix

### What I'll do in the future
Image cropping processing

Applying various visual filters to an image

Using the Canny method to stroke image borders

A. Based on the fact that image processing is a highly loaded computing process, I want to write a load distribution under high load (many requests at the same time)

Based on point A, I need to write an artificial simulation of a high load

#### NOTE: this projects is not finished yet. All implemented logic are listed in "What I've done" section
